**House Price Prediction :**
Machine Learning model to predict house
price using linear regression only

**Understanding Linear Regression:**
Linear regression is a fundamental supervised learning algorithm in machine learning. It aims to establish a linear relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). In the context of house price prediction, the dependent variable will be the house price, and the independent variables can be factors like the size of the house, number of bedrooms, location, etc.

House Price Prediction with Linear Regression Involves Following Steps:

**Dataset Collection:** Gather historical house price data and corresponding features from platforms like Zillow or Kaggle.
**Data Preprocessing:** Clean the data, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering, such as converting categorical variables to numerical representations.
**Splitting the Dataset:** Divide the dataset into training and testing sets for model building and evaluation.
**Building the Model:** Create a linear regression model to learn the relationships between features and house prices.
**Model Evaluation:** Assess the model’s performance on the testing set using metrics like MSE or RMSE.
**Fine-tuning the Model:** Adjust hyperparameters or try different algorithms to improve the model’s accuracy.
**Deployment and Prediction:** Deploy the robust model into a real-world application for predicting house prices based on user inputs.

**Iris Flowers Classification :**
Predict the different species of flowers on
the length of there petals and sepals

Classification of iris flowers is perhaps the best-known example of machine learning.

The aim is to classify iris flowers among three species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) from sepals' and petals' length and width measurements.

The iris data set contains fifty instances of each of the three species.

The central goal is to design a model that makes proper classifications for new flowers.
In other words, one which exhibits good generalization.

Machine learning is a field of study and is concerned with algorithms that learn from examples.


Classification is a task that requires the use of machine learning algorithms that learn how to assign a class label to examples from the problem domain. An easy to understand example is classifying emails as “spam” or “not spam.”

There are many different types of classification tasks that you may encounter in machine learning and specialized approaches to modeling that may be used for each

Multi-Class Classification
Multi-Label Classification
